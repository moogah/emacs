* Introduction
This file configures Projectile, a project interaction library for Emacs. Projectile provides easy project management and navigation, with features for project discovery, file navigation, and project-specific commands execution.

* Basic Configuration
Setup lexical binding for better closures and variable scoping.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

* Projectile Core
** Basic Setup
Configure the main Projectile package with key bindings.

[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Documentation]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package projectile
  :straight t
  :init
  (projectile-mode +1)
  :bind (:map projectile-mode-map
              ("s-p" . projectile-command-map) ;; map to "super" (command) key
              ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map))
  :custom
  ;; Store known projects in git-controlled location
  ;; Can be overridden per-machine in config/local/{machine-role}.el
  (projectile-known-projects-file
   (expand-file-name "state/projectile/projectile-bookmarks.eld" jf/emacs-dir)))

* Custom Project Types
** Python with Docker Compose
Define a custom project type for Python projects that use pytest and docker-compose for testing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; configure python custom project type for testing with docker-compose
(projectile-register-project-type 'python '("pytest.ini" "docker-compose.yaml")
                                  :project-file "pytest.ini"
                                  :test "docker-compose run test-watch"
                                  :test-prefix "test")
#+end_src

* Usage Notes
** Key Commands
Projectile provides many useful commands through its command map:

- `C-c p f` or `s-p f`: Find file in project
- `C-c p s s` or `s-p s s`: Search in project (using grep)
- `C-c p p` or `s-p p`: Switch project
- `C-c p b` or `s-p b`: Switch to project buffer
- `C-c p t` or `s-p t`: Toggle between implementation and test
- `C-c p c` or `s-p c`: Run project compilation command
- `C-c p P` or `s-p P`: Run project test command

** Project Discovery
Projectile can automatically recognize many project types by looking for specific files:

- Git, Mercurial, and other VCS root directories
- Project build files (Makefile, package.json, etc.)
- Language-specific project files (e.g., Gemfile for Ruby)

** Command Caching
To improve performance for large projects, Projectile caches project files. You may occasionally need to refresh the cache with `C-c p i`.

* Project Integration
The custom Python project type defined in this configuration provides specific benefits:

- Automatically recognizes Python projects with pytest.ini and docker-compose.yaml
- Sets up test commands to run through docker-compose
- Configures test file prefix/suffix patterns for easy test navigation

* TODO Improvements
- Add additional custom project types for other languages/frameworks
- Configure Projectile with Consult for enhanced completion
- Set up project-specific compilation commands
- Consider adding persp-mode or perspective.el integration for project workspaces
- Add snippets for common Projectile workflows
