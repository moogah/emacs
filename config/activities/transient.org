* Introduction

Transient UI system for activities-extensions, providing an interactive
menu for creating and managing activities.

* Lexical Binding

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

* Scope Management

Functions for managing transient scope state.

Scope structure:
  :projects - alist of (project-path . git-action)
  :git-action - default action for newly selected projects
  :selected-project - currently selected project for detail view (or nil)
  :activity-name - user-provided name
  :sanitized-name - slugified name for git operations
  :gptel-preset - selected gptel preset template name

* Custom Infix Classes

Custom transient infix classes for project toggles and git action selection.

** Project Toggle Class

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defclass activities-ext--switch-project (transient-infix)
  ((project-path :initarg :project-path)
   (project-name :initarg :project-name))
  "Infix for toggling individual project selection.")

(cl-defmethod transient-infix-read ((obj activities-ext--switch-project))
  "Toggle project selection on/off."
  (let* ((path (oref obj project-path)))
    (activities-ext--scope-toggle-project path)
    ;; Return current selection state for value storage
    (not (null (assoc path (activities-ext--scope-projects))))))

(cl-defmethod transient-format-value ((obj activities-ext--switch-project))
  "Format project toggle value display with action indicator."
  (let* ((path (oref obj project-path))
         (projects (activities-ext--scope-projects))
         (selected (assoc path projects)))
    (if selected
        (let* ((action (cdr selected))
               (indicator (pcase action
                           ('worktree "W")

                           ('none "·"))))
          (propertize (format "(✓ %s)" indicator) 'face 'transient-value))
      (propertize "( )" 'face 'transient-inactive-value))))

(cl-defmethod transient-init-value ((obj activities-ext--switch-project))
  "Initialize value from scope."
  (let* ((path (oref obj project-path))
         (projects (activities-ext--scope-projects)))
    (oset obj value (not (null (assoc path projects))))))
#+end_src

** Git Action Radio Class

NOTE: This custom infix class has been removed along with the git action radio
buttons. Per-project action cycling in the Selected Projects column replaced
this functionality.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Git action radio class removed - no longer needed
#+end_src

* Infix Definitions

Define individual infix commands for dynamic generation.

** Project Toggle Infix Factory

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun activities-ext--make-project-infix (key project-path project-name)
  "Create a project toggle infix for KEY, PROJECT-PATH, and PROJECT-NAME."
  (let ((command-name (intern (format "activities-ext--toggle-project-%s" key))))
    (defalias command-name
      (lambda ()
        (interactive)
        (let* ((projects (activities-ext--scope-projects))
               (currently-selected (assoc project-path projects)))
          (activities-ext--scope-toggle-project project-path)
          (not currently-selected))))

    (put command-name 'transient-format-value
         (lambda ()
           (let* ((projects (activities-ext--scope-projects))
                  (selected (assoc project-path projects)))
             (if selected
                 (propertize "(✓)" 'face 'transient-value)
               (propertize "( )" 'face 'transient-inactive-value)))))

    command-name))
#+end_src

** Git Action Infix Definitions

NOTE: These infix definitions have been removed. The "Selected Projects" column
now provides per-project action cycling via numbered keys (1-9, 0), which
replaced the global git action radio buttons.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Git action infixes removed - now handled by Selected Projects column cycling
#+end_src

* Dynamic Suffix Generation

Functions to generate suffix lists dynamically.

** Project List Generator

Dynamic key assignment using gptel pattern: tries to use first letter of project
name, falls back to first available key. Supports all projects (up to 36 with a-z, 0-9).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun activities-ext--generate-project-suffixes ()

Uses first letter of project name when available, otherwise assigns next free key.

  (when (fboundp 'projectile-relevant-known-projects)
    (let ((projects (projectile-relevant-known-projects)))
      (when projects
        (cl-loop for project in projects
                 ;; Pool of available keys (a-z only)
                 ;; Reserved: q (quit), number keys 0-9 (used by Selected Projects column)
                 with unused-keys = (cl-set-difference

                 for name = (file-name-nondirectory (directory-file-name project))
                 ;; Try to find first character of name in unused keys, else take first available
                 for key-char = (seq-find (lambda (k) (member k unused-keys))
                                         name
                                         (seq-first unused-keys))
                 ;; Remove assigned key from pool to prevent collisions
                 do (setq unused-keys (delete key-char unused-keys))
                 ;; Skip projects that don't get a key (>26 projects)
                 when key-char
                 collect (let ((key-str (key-description (list key-char)))

** Selected Projects Suffixes Generator

Generates interactive list of selected projects with action cycling.
Each project gets a numbered key (1-9, 0) to cycle through git actions.

* Main Transient Prefix

Interactive menu for creating extended activities with two-column workflow.

Two-column layout:
1. Project Selection (left) - all available projects with letter keys
   - Press key to toggle selection (add with worktree or remove)
2. Selected Projects (right) - shows selected projects with numbered keys (1-9, 0)
   - Press number key to cycle that project's git action: W → B → ·

Key behaviors:
- Left column (letters): Toggle selection on/off (defaults to worktree when adding)
- Right column (numbers): Cycle through git actions for that specific project

Visual indicators:
- [W] = worktree
- [B] = branch
- [·] = none (no git operations)
