* Introduction
This file configures beads.el, an Emacs interface for the Beads issue tracking system.
Beads is a lightweight, file-based issue tracker that stores issues in SQLite databases,
designed for local-first development workflows.

* Basic Configuration
Setup lexical binding and core Beads functionality.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Core beads.el setup
(use-package beads
  :straight (beads :type git :host codeberg :repo "ctietze/beads.el")
  :commands (beads beads-list beads-new)
  :config
  ;; Configure beads database location if needed
  ;; By default, beads looks for .beads/beads.db in the project root
  ;; This can be customized per-project
  )
#+end_src

* Additional Configuration
Future configuration options can be added here as needed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Additional beads configuration can go here
;; Examples:
;; - Custom keybindings
;; - Integration with projectile or other tools
;; - Custom faces or display options
#+end_src
