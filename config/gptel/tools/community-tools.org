* Introduction

This file installs and configures community-maintained gptel tool collections.
These tools extend the LLM's capabilities with filesystem operations, web access,
org-mode integration, and Emacs introspection.

All tools are configured with confirmation enabled by default for security.

* Basic Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Set confirmation mode to 'auto - let tools and agents decide
;; - 'auto: Respect per-tool :confirm and per-agent confirm-tool-calls settings
;; - t: Always confirm all tools
;; - nil: Never confirm any tools
(setq gptel-confirm-tool-calls 'auto)
(setq gptel-use-tools t)
#+end_src

* GPTEL Agent

NOTE: gptel-agent configuration has been moved to =major-modes/gpt.org= to properly
configure the agent directory and tool loading order. See the "GPTEL Agent" section
in gpt.org for the current configuration.

* GPTEL Org Tools

Provides org-mode specific tools for:
- Tag extraction and searching across org files
- Heading extraction and filtering
- Date-based query searching
- Full-text search using org-ql
- Agenda viewing for task management

Perfect for integration with org-roam knowledge management.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package gptel-got
  :straight '(gptel-got :type git
                         :host nil
                         :repo "https://codeberg.org/bajsicki/gptel-got")
  :after (gptel org-ql)
  :demand t
  :config
  ;; Integrate with org-roam and daily journal workflows
  ;; Tools will respect gptel-confirm-tool-calls for safety
  )
#+end_src

* LLM Tool Collection

Comprehensive collection of tools for:
- Filesystem operations (read, create, edit files)
- Buffer manipulation and searching
- Directory operations and file globbing
- Recursive grep functionality
- System command execution

From: https://github.com/skissue/llm-tool-collection

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package llm-tool-collection
  :straight '(llm-tool-collection :type git
                                   :host github
                                   :repo "skissue/llm-tool-collection")
  :after gptel
  :demand t
  :config
  ;; Confirmation enabled for destructive operations
  ;; Note: Some overlap with gptel-agent filesystem tools
  )
#+end_src

* Ragmacs

Tools for Emacs introspection and documentation:
- Source code exploration of Elisp packages
- Documentation synthesis and summarization
- Docstring translation and analysis
- Recursive tool calling for deep code analysis

Excellent for understanding unfamiliar Emacs packages.

From: https://github.com/positron-solutions/ragmacs

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ragmacs
  :straight '(ragmacs :type git
                       :host github
                       :repo "positron-solutions/ragmacs")
  :after gptel
  :demand t
  :config
  ;; Enable recursive tool calling for deep introspection
  ;; Tools will respect global confirmation settings
  )
#+end_src

* Notes

** Tool Overlap
Some functionality overlaps between collections:
- gptel-agent and llm-tool-collection both provide filesystem tools
- Multiple packages provide buffer manipulation

The LLM will choose the most appropriate tool based on context.

** Confirmation Settings
All tools respect the global =gptel-confirm-tool-calls= setting.

To disable confirmations for specific operations (not recommended):
#+begin_example
(setq gptel-confirm-tool-calls nil)
#+end_example

To configure per-tool, see each package's documentation.

** Tool Selection
Tools can be selected from gptel's transient menu (=M-x gptel-menu=):
1. Navigate to the tools section
2. Select which tools to enable (globally or buffer-locally)
3. Configure confirmation and result inclusion settings
