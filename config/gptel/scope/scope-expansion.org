#+title: GPTEL Scope Expansion UI

#+property: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle scope-expansion.el
#+auto_tangle: y

* Overview

This module provides an interactive UI for handling scope violations in gptel sessions.
When a tool attempts to access a resource outside its allowed scope, the user is
presented with three options via a transient menu:

1. **Deny** - Reject the tool call and return an error to the LLM
2. **Add to scope** - Update scope.yml permanently to allow this resource
3. **Allow once** - Temporarily allow for the current LLM response only

* State Management

Transient scope mechanism is used to pass violation info and callbacks to suffix commands.
See transient-tools.org for detailed architecture documentation.

No buffer-local variables needed - data is passed via transient's :scope mechanism.

* Transient Menu

The main UI for handling scope violations.

* Scope Updaters

Functions to update scope.yml with new permissions.

*Key format convention:* YAML files use =snake_case= keys (e.g., =org_roam_patterns=,
=shell_commands=). On read, =scope-core= normalizes these to kebab-case (=:org-roam-patterns=,
=:shell-commands=). When writing back, these updaters use the original =snake_case= format
so that YAML files remain consistent and human-readable.
