#+title: GPTEL Scope Expansion UI

* Overview

This module provides an interactive UI for handling scope violations in gptel sessions.
When a tool attempts to access a resource outside its allowed scope, the user is
presented with three options via a transient menu:

1. **Deny** - Reject the tool call and return an error to the LLM
2. **Add to scope** - Update scope.yml permanently to allow this resource
3. **Allow once** - Temporarily allow for the current LLM response only

* State Management

Transient scope mechanism is used to pass violation info and callbacks to suffix commands.
See transient-tools.org for detailed architecture documentation.

No buffer-local variables needed - data is passed via transient's :scope mechanism.

* Helper Functions

** Get Scope File Path

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jf/gptel-scope--get-scope-file-path ()
  "Get the path to scope.yml for the current buffer context.
Returns absolute path to scope.yml, or nil if context cannot be determined."

** Validate Scope File Writable

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  "Validate SCOPE-FILE exists and is writable.
Signals user-error if any check fails."
  (unless scope-file

** Read Scope File as YAML

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jf/gptel-scope--read-scope-file-as-yaml (scope-file)
  "Read and parse SCOPE-FILE as YAML.
Returns parsed plist, or signals user-error if parsing fails."

* Scope Updaters

Functions to update scope.yml with new permissions.

*Key format convention:* YAML files use =snake_case= keys (e.g., =org_roam_patterns=,
=bash_tools=). On read, =scope-core= normalizes these to kebab-case (=:org-roam-patterns=,
=:bash-tools=). When writing back, these updaters use the original =snake_case= format
so that YAML files remain consistent and human-readable.

** Add Bash Command to Scope

This function handles two types of bash scope expansion:
1. *Command pattern expansion* - Adds bash command to category (read_only or safe_write)
2. *Directory scope expansion* - Adds directory to paths section (delegates to =add-path-to-scope=)

*** Expansion Examples

*Example 1: Add command to category*

When LLM requests:
#+begin_example
request_scope_expansion(
  tool_name="run_bash_command",
  patterns=["tree"],
  justification="Need to visualize directory structure"
)
#+end_example

Result: Command =tree= is added to =bash_tools.categories.read_only.commands= list in scope.yml.

*Example 2: Add directory to path scope*

When LLM requests:
#+begin_example
request_scope_expansion(
  tool_name="run_bash_command",
  patterns=["/Users/jefffarr/other-project"],
  justification="Need to explore sibling project"
)
#+end_example

Result: Directory =/Users/jefffarr/other-project/**= is added to =paths.read= (for read_only commands) or =paths.write= (for safe_write commands) in scope.yml.

*** Delegation Logic

The function uses heuristics to distinguish command patterns from directory paths:
- If resource is an existing directory: delegates to =jf/gptel-scope--add-path-to-scope=
- If resource ends with =/=: treats as directory, delegates to path expansion
- If resource contains =/=: treats as directory path, delegates to path expansion
- Otherwise: treats as command name, adds to bash_tools categories

This allows the LLM to request either command expansion (="tree"=) or directory expansion (="/tmp"=) using the same tool.

* YAML Helper Functions

** Key Normalization Helper

This function is the inverse of =jf/gptel-scope--normalize-plist-keys= in scope-core.org.
Together they provide bidirectional conversion between YAML snake_case and Elisp kebab-case.

*Note on recursion asymmetry:* =normalize-plist-keys= is recursive (processes nested plists internally),
while =kebab-to-snake= is non-recursive (called by =write-yaml-plist= at each nesting level).
Both strategies achieve complete key conversion at all nesting levels.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jf/gptel-scope--kebab-to-snake (key)
  "Convert KEY from kebab-case to snake_case for YAML output.
E.g., :org-roam-patterns becomes org_roam_patterns.

Inverse function: jf/gptel-scope--normalize-plist-keys (scope-core.org)
