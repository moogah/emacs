* Overview

This module provides the core infrastructure for scope-aware tools in gptel sessions. It implements:
- Generic =gptel-make-scoped-tool= macro that eliminates boilerplate
- Tool-specific validators for fine-grained permission control
- YAML plan parser/formatter for v2.0 tool-level permission format

** Architecture (v2.0)

The scope system uses YAML plan documents stored alongside context files:
- Location: Same directory as =session.md= (e.g., =~/.gptel/sessions/SESSION_ID/branches/main/scope.yml=)
- Format: v2.0 YAML with tool-level permissions (write_file_in_scope, edit_file_in_scope, etc.)
- Default policy: Deny by default, explicit tool configuration required
- Convention: Filesystem is source of truth, no in-memory tracking needed

Example scope.yml structure:
#+begin_example yaml
paths:
  read: ["/**"]
  write: ["/project/**"]
  deny: ["**/.git/**", "**/.env"]

org_roam_patterns:
  subdirectory: ["gptel/**"]
  tags: ["gptel"]

bash_tools:
  categories:
    read_only:
      commands: [ls, find, grep, cat, pwd]
    safe_write:
      commands: [mkdir, touch, echo]
    dangerous:
      commands: []
  deny: [rm, sudo, mv, chmod]
#+end_example

** Key Design Principles

1. *Tool-level permissions*: Each tool has independent configuration (write_file vs edit_file)
2. *Generic macro eliminates duplication*: =gptel-make-scoped-tool= handles all boilerplate
3. *Structured errors returned to LLM*: Tools return descriptive errors, not exceptions
4. *LLM mediates user communication*: No automatic prompts, LLM uses request_scope_expansion
5. *Read operations scope-controlled*: But templates grant permissive =/**= patterns by default

** Module Organization

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. *Dependencies* - Required modules
2. *Tool Categorization System* - Maps tools to validation strategies
3. *Tool Wrapper Macro* - Public API for creating scoped tools
4. *Scope Configuration Location Convention* - Filesystem conventions
5. *Configuration Loading Functions* - Load and parse scope.yml
6. *Allow-Once Mechanism* - Temporary permissions for single use
7. *Validation System* - Validators for each tool category
8. *Glob Pattern Matching* - Utility functions for path matching
9. *Error Formatting* - Standardized error responses

*Note:* Sections are ordered by dependency relationships rather than conceptual grouping.
For example, glob pattern matching appears after validation system because it's
called by validators, even though conceptually it could be in a utilities section.

* Tool Categorization System

This section defines the mapping from tool names to validation strategies.

** Tool Category Constant

The core categorization system maps each tool to its validation strategy and operation type.

#+begin_src elisp
(defconst jf/gptel-scope--tool-categories
  '(;; Path-based: read operations
    ("read_file" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("list_project_files" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("list_project_directories" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("search_project_content" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("list_test_files" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("find_related_test" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("find_related_files" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("check_ggtags_project" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("find_definition" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("find_references" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("find_symbol" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("get_node_at_position" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("get_node_info" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("get_node_context" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("get_syntax_tree" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("list_functions" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("list_classes" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("list_imports" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("extract_definition" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("query_nodes" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("find_nodes_by_type" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("find_nodes_in_range" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("get_scope_structure" . (:validation path :operation read))
    ("explain_ggtags_indexing" . (:validation path :operation read))

    ;; Path-based: write operations
    ("write_file_in_scope" . (:validation path :operation write))
    ("edit_file_in_scope" . (:validation path :operation write))
    ("create_ggtags_project" . (:validation path :operation write))
    ("update_ggtags_project" . (:validation path :operation write))

    ;; Pattern-based: org-roam operations
    ("create_roam_node_in_scope" . (:validation pattern :operation write))
    ("add_roam_tags_in_scope" . (:validation pattern :operation write))
    ("link_roam_nodes_in_scope" . (:validation pattern :operation write))

    ;; Command-based: shell operations

    ;; Bash validation: scoped bash commands
    ("run_bash_command" . (:validation bash :operation write))

    ;; Meta tools (always pass)
    ("PersistentAgent" . (:validation meta :operation delegate))
    ("request_scope_expansion" . (:validation meta :operation meta)))
  "Tool → validation strategy mapping.

Each tool maps to a plist with:
  :validation - Validation strategy (path, pattern, command, bash, meta)
  :operation - Operation type (read, write, delegate, meta)

Validation strategies:
  path    - Validate against paths.read/write/deny lists
  pattern - Validate against org_roam_patterns
  bash    - Validate against bash_tools.categories and paths
  meta    - Always allowed (no validation)

Operation types:
  read     - Read-only access
  write    - Write/modify access
  delegate - Delegate to sub-agent
  meta     - Meta-operations (inspect scope, request expansion)")
#+end_src

* Tool Wrapper Macro

This section provides the generic wrapper macro that eliminates boilerplate code in scope-aware tools.

** Argument Normalization

Tool functions receive arguments as vectors (from JSON), but we need to work with lists internally.

#+begin_src elisp
(defun jf/gptel-scope--normalize-args (args)
  "Convert ARGS from vector to list if needed.
Tool functions receive vectors from JSON serialization."
  (if (vectorp args)
      (append args nil)
    args))
#+end_src

** Generic Scoped Tool Macro

This macro wraps the common pattern used by all scope-aware tools:
1. Get session ID
2. Load scope plan
3. Check plan exists
4. Validate tool permission
5. Execute tool body if allowed
6. Return formatted error if denied

#+begin_src elisp
(defmacro gptel-make-scoped-tool (name description args category &rest body)
  "Create a scope-aware gptel tool with automatic validation.

NAME: Tool name string (e.g., \"write_file_in_scope\")
DESCRIPTION: Tool description for LLM
ARGS: List of argument specs (same format as gptel-make-tool :args)
CATEGORY: Resource category (\"filesystem\", \"org_roam\", \"shell\")
BODY: Tool implementation - executed only if scope check passes

The macro automatically:
- Loads scope config from scope.yml in current buffer's directory
- Checks tool permission using v3.0 validation
- Normalizes arguments (vector->list)
- Formats errors on scope violation
- Handles exceptions

BODY is executed with tool arguments available as variables and should
return the success result plist. The first argument in ARGS should be
the primary resource identifier (filepath, node-id, command, etc.)."

#+end_src

** Usage Examples

*** Simple Read-Only Tool

#+begin_example elisp
(gptel-make-scoped-tool
 "read_file_in_scope"
 "Read file contents if in read scope."

 (list '(:name "filepath"
         :type string
         :description "Absolute file path to read"))

 "filesystem"

 ;; Tool body - filepath is available as a variable
 (condition-case err
     (list :success t
           :content (with-temp-buffer
                     (insert-file-contents filepath)
                     (buffer-string)))
   (error
    (list :success nil
          :error "read_failed"
          :message (error-message-string err)))))
#+end_example

*** Tool with Multiple Arguments

#+begin_example elisp
(gptel-make-scoped-tool
 "run_bash_command"
 "Execute shell command in specified directory."

 (list '(:name "command"
         :type string
         :description "Shell command to execute")
       '(:name "directory"
         :type string
         :description "Working directory"))

 "bash"

 ;; Both command and directory are available as variables
 (let* ((result (jf/gptel-bash--execute-command command directory))
        (exit-code (plist-get result :exit_code)))
   (list :success (zerop exit-code)
         :output (plist-get result :output)
         :exit_code exit-code)))
#+end_example

*** Valid Category Values

- ="filesystem"= - For file read/write operations (validates against :paths)
- ="org_roam"= - For org-roam node operations (validates against :org-roam-patterns)
- ="bash"= - For bash category-based operations (validates against :bash-tools)

*** Body Requirements

The BODY must return a plist with at minimum:
- =:success= - Boolean indicating operation success

On success, include operation-specific fields:
- =:content=, =:output=, =:result=, etc.

On failure, include:
- =:error= - Error type string
- =:message= - Human-readable error message

The macro handles:
- Scope validation errors (returns formatted error automatically)
- Unexpected exceptions (wrapped in condition-case)

You only need to handle tool-specific errors in BODY.

*** Common Patterns

*Error handling in body:*
#+begin_example elisp
(condition-case err
    (progn
      ;; risky operation
      (list :success t :result value))
  (error
   (list :success nil
         :error "operation_failed"
         :message (error-message-string err))))
#+end_example

*Argument binding:*
Arguments are automatically bound as variables matching their =:name= field.
If ARGS contains =(:name "filepath")=, the variable =filepath= is available in BODY.

*First argument convention:*
The first argument should be the primary resource identifier (filepath, node-id, command, etc.)
This is used for error formatting when scope validation fails.

* Scope Configuration Location Convention

Tools locate scope configuration using a simple filesystem convention:

=scope.yml= (plain YAML, no frontmatter) in the same directory as =session.md=

Scope configuration contains:
- =paths= section for filesystem/projectile/treesitter tools
- =org_roam_patterns= section for org-roam tools
- =bash_tools= section for bash command tools with category-based validation

** Bash Tools Configuration Structure

The =bash_tools= section categorizes commands by operational impact and validates directory scope:

#+begin_example yaml
bash_tools:
  categories:
    read_only:
      commands: [ls, find, grep, rg, pwd, cat, head, tail, wc, file]
    safe_write:
      commands: [mkdir, touch, echo]
    dangerous:
      commands: []  # Requires explicit user approval
  deny:
    - rm
    - sudo
    - mv
    - chmod
    - shutdown
    - reboot
#+end_example

*** Command Categories

- *read_only* - Commands that only read data, allowed in paths.read or paths.write
- *safe_write* - Commands that create/modify safely, require paths.write
- *dangerous* - Commands requiring explicit approval via request_scope_expansion
- *deny* - Commands never allowed (destructive/security-sensitive)

*** Validation Flow

1. Check deny list first (highest priority)
2. Categorize base command (first token before pipes/redirects)
3. Resolve directory to absolute path and real path (symlink resolution)
4. Validate directory against category's path scope requirement:
   - read_only: requires paths.read OR paths.write
   - safe_write: requires paths.write
   - dangerous: always denied unless explicitly approved

This eliminates the need for complex lookups:
- No registry required
- No session ID tracking needed
- Filesystem is the source of truth

Tools execute in the context of the gptel buffer, which has the buffer-local variable
=jf/gptel--branch-dir= set during session initialization. The scope loading functions
use this to find =scope.yml= in the same directory as the context file.

* Configuration Loading Functions

** Load Scope Configuration

Load and parse scope configuration from scope.yml.

Convention: scope.yml is always in the same directory as session.md.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'yaml)  ; Emacs built-in YAML parser

(defun jf/gptel-scope--load-config ()
  "Load scope configuration from scope.yml.
Returns plist with:
  :paths-read - List of allowed read paths
  :paths-write - List of allowed write paths
  :paths-deny - List of denied paths
  :org-roam-patterns - Plist with :subdirectory, :tags, :node-ids
  :bash-tools - Plist with :categories and :deny lists
                (YAML uses snake_case: bash_tools, read_only
                 Elisp uses kebab-case: :bash-tools, :read-only)

Uses buffer-local jf/gptel--branch-dir if available.
Returns nil if scope.yml not found or can't be parsed."
  (condition-case err
      (let ((context-dir (or (and (boundp 'jf/gptel--branch-dir) jf/gptel--branch-dir)
                             (and (buffer-file-name)
                                  (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name))))))
        (when context-dir
          (let ((scope-file (expand-file-name jf/gptel-session--scope-file context-dir)))
            (when (file-exists-p scope-file)
              (jf/gptel-scope--parse-scope-yml scope-file)))))
    (error
     (message "Error loading scope config: %s" (error-message-string err))
     nil)))
#+end_src

** Key Normalization Helper

Normalize YAML keys by converting underscores to hyphens for internal consistency.

*Bidirectional conversion:*
- *Read path*: YAML =bash_tools= (snake_case) → Elisp =:bash-tools= (kebab-case)
- *Write path*: Elisp =:bash-tools= (kebab-case) → YAML =bash_tools= (snake_case)

This normalization is automatic and bidirectional:
1. When loading scope.yml, =jf/gptel-scope--normalize-plist-keys= converts all underscore keys to hyphens
2. When writing scope.yml, =jf/gptel-scope--kebab-to-snake= (in scope-expansion.org) converts hyphens back to underscores

*Example:* Users write =bash_tools= in YAML files, but code uses =:bash-tools= internally.

This is especially important for =bash_tools= since it's the most recent addition to the schema.

#+begin_src elisp
(defun jf/gptel-scope--normalize-plist-keys (plist)
  "Normalize all keys in PLIST by converting underscores to hyphens.
Recursively processes nested plists.
Example: :bash_tools -> :bash-tools, :read_only -> :read-only"
  (when plist
    (let ((result nil))
      (while plist
        (let* ((key (car plist))
               (value (cadr plist))
               (normalized-key (if (keywordp key)
                                   (intern (concat ":" (replace-regexp-in-string
                                                       "_" "-"
                                                       (substring (symbol-name key) 1))))
                                 key))
               (normalized-value (if (and (listp value)
                                         (keywordp (car value)))
                                    (jf/gptel-scope--normalize-plist-keys value)
                                  value)))
          (setq result (append result (list normalized-key normalized-value)))
          (setq plist (cddr plist))))
      result)))
#+end_src

** Parse Scope YAML

Parse scope configuration from a plain YAML file (no frontmatter).
Automatically normalizes all keys from underscore to hyphenated format.

#+begin_src elisp
(defun jf/gptel-scope--parse-scope-yml (scope-file)
  "Parse scope configuration from SCOPE-FILE (plain YAML, no frontmatter).

converted to hyphenated keys (bash-tools) for consistency."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents scope-file)
    (let* ((parsed (yaml-parse-string (buffer-string)
                                      :object-type 'plist
                                      :sequence-type 'list))
           (normalized (jf/gptel-scope--normalize-plist-keys parsed))
           (paths (plist-get normalized :paths))
           (org-roam (plist-get normalized :org-roam-patterns))
           (bash-tools (plist-get normalized :bash-tools)))
      (list :paths-read (plist-get paths :read)
            :paths-write (plist-get paths :write)
            :paths-deny (plist-get paths :deny)
            :org-roam-patterns org-roam
            :bash-tools bash-tools))))
#+end_src


* Allow-Once Mechanism

Temporary permissions that last only for the current LLM response turn.

** Consumption Semantics

*IMPORTANT:* Allow-once permissions are consumed *before* the tool body executes,
not after. This is a deliberate design choice with the following implications:

1. *Single-use guarantee:* Each permission can only be used once, even if multiple
   tool calls in the same LLM response attempt to use it.

2. *Permission consumed on check:* The permission is removed from the list when
   =jf/gptel-scope--check-allow-once= returns =t=, before the tool body runs.

3. *No rollback on failure:* If the tool body errors after the permission check,
   the permission is already consumed and cannot be retried.

4. *Race condition potential:* If an LLM response is interrupted (network error,
   timeout, user cancels) after permission check but before tool completion, the
   permission is consumed but the operation may not have completed.

This behavior is intentional to maintain security: allowing retry after failure
could enable repeated attempts at sensitive operations. Users can grant another
allow-once permission if needed.

The alternative approach (consuming after execution) would require tracking
tool execution state and handling partial failures, adding significant complexity
for minimal benefit.

** Buffer-Local Allow-Once List

#+begin_src elisp
(defvar-local jf/gptel-scope--allow-once-list nil

* Validation System (v3.0)

This section implements the v3.0 validation system with three strategies:
path-based, pattern-based, and command-based.

** Pattern Matching Helper

Check if a path matches any pattern in a list.

#+begin_src elisp
(defun jf/gptel-scope--matches-any-pattern (path patterns)
  "Check if PATH matches any pattern in PATTERNS list.
Returns t if any pattern matches, nil otherwise."

** Bash-Based Validator

Validates bash commands against category-based permissions and directory scope.

*Used by:* =run_bash_command= tool (see scope-shell-tools.org)

This validator implements the category-based validation strategy for bash commands, checking:
1. Command is not in deny list
2. Command is in a known category (read_only, safe_write, dangerous)
3. Directory matches category's path scope requirement

*Function naming convention:*

The bash validator function is named =jf/gptel-scope--validate-bash-tool= (using the =scope= namespace), while helper functions in scope-shell-tools.org use the =jf/gptel-bash--= prefix. This reflects their different roles:
- =jf/gptel-scope--*= functions are part of the core scope validation system
- =jf/gptel-bash--*= functions are tool-specific helpers for command parsing and execution

This separation keeps validation logic in scope-core.org and tool implementation details in scope-shell-tools.org.

*** Validator Return Values

The bash validator returns structured error information to help the LLM understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

*Success case:*
#+begin_example
(:allowed t)
#+end_example

*Error cases:*

1. *Command not allowed* (command not in any category):
   #+begin_example
   (:allowed nil
    :reason "command-not-allowed"
    :tool "run_bash_command"
    :resource "tree"
    :command "tree"
    :message "Command 'tree' is not in any bash_tools category (read_only, safe_write, dangerous). Use request_scope_expansion to request adding this command to an appropriate category.")
   #+end_example

2. *Denied command* (in bash_tools.deny list):
   #+begin_example
   (:allowed nil
    :reason "denied-command"
    :tool "run_bash_command"
    :resource "rm -rf /tmp/file"
    :command "rm -rf /tmp/file"
    :message "Command 'rm' is explicitly denied in bash_tools.deny list.")
   #+end_example

3. *Directory not in scope* (directory doesn't match paths.read or paths.write):
   #+begin_example
   (:allowed nil
    :reason "directory-not-in-scope"
    :tool "run_bash_command"
    :resource "/Users/jefffarr/other-project"
    :command "ls -la"
    :directory "/Users/jefffarr/other-project"
    :required-scope "read"
    :allowed-patterns ("/Users/jefffarr/emacs/**" "/Users/jefffarr/projects/**")
    :message "Directory '/Users/jefffarr/other-project' is not in scope for read operations. Command 'ls' requires read access. Use request_scope_expansion to request access.")
   #+end_example

4. *Dangerous command* (requires explicit approval):
   #+begin_example
   (:allowed nil
    :reason "dangerous-command"
    :tool "run_bash_command"
    :resource "dangerous-cmd"
    :command "dangerous-cmd"
    :message "Command 'dangerous-cmd' is categorized as dangerous and requires explicit user approval via request_scope_expansion.")
   #+end_example

5. *No bash_tools configuration*:
   #+begin_example
   (:allowed nil
    :reason "command-not-allowed"
    :tool "run_bash_command"
    :resource "ls"
    :command "ls"
    :message "No bash_tools configuration found. All commands denied by default.")
   #+end_example

These structured errors allow the LLM to:
- Understand exactly why the command was rejected
- See which patterns would allow the command (=:allowed-patterns=)
- Know what scope level is required (=:required-scope=)
- Call =request_scope_expansion= with appropriate justification

*Error field consistency:*

The bash validator includes custom =:message= fields for LLM-friendly error messages. This is consistent with how =jf/gptel-scope--format-tool-error= (line 1040) works:
- The validator returns =:message= in check-result
- =format-tool-error= uses this custom message if present
- Falls back to generic message format if =:message= not provided

This pattern allows validators to provide context-specific guidance while maintaining a consistent error structure across all validation types.

* Glob Pattern Matching

** Convert Glob to Regex

Convert glob patterns to regex, supporting =**=, =*=, and =?= wildcards.

Supports:
  ** - Match any characters including /
  *  - Match any characters except /
