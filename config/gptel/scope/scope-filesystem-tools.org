#+title: GPTEL Scope Manager - Filesystem Tools
#+author: Jeff Farr
#+property: header-args:elisp :tangle scope-filesystem-tools.el :comments both

* Overview

This module provides scope-aware filesystem tools for gptel sessions. Tools check approved scope patterns internally and return structured errors to the LLM when operations are outside approved scope.

** Key Principles

1. *Read operations always allowed*: No scope checking on reads
2. *Writes check scope internally*: Tools validate before execution
3. *Structured errors for LLM*: Return plist with error details, not exceptions
4. *LLM mediates communication*: LLM receives errors and handles user interaction

* Read File Tool (No Scope Check)

Read operations are always allowed regardless of scope plan.

#+begin_src elisp
(gptel-make-tool
 :name "read_file"
 :description "Read contents of a file at the specified path.
Always allowed regardless of scope plan (read operations are unrestricted).
Use this to read any file content you need to examine."
 :args (list '(:name "path"
               :type string
               :description "Directory path")
             '(:name "filename"
               :type string
               :description "Name of file"))
 :category "filesystem"
 :function
 (lambda (path filename)
   (let ((full-path (expand-file-name filename path)))
     (if (file-exists-p full-path)
         (list :success t
               :content (with-temp-buffer
                         (insert-file-contents full-path)
                         (buffer-string))
               :full_path full-path)
       (list :success nil
             :error "file_not_found"
             :message (format "File not found: %s" full-path))))))

* Write File Tool (Scope-Aware)

Write content to a file, checking scope before execution.

#+begin_src elisp
(gptel-make-tool
 :name "write_file_in_scope"
 :description "Write content to a file, respecting scope plan.
Returns error if path is not in approved scope patterns.
Use request_scope_expansion tool to ask user for approval if needed.

Example error response:
{:success nil :error \"scope_violation\" :resource \"/path/to/file\"
 :allowed_patterns [\"/approved/**/*.el\"]
 :message \"Write operation denied. Use request_scope_expansion to ask user.\"}

When you receive a scope violation:
1. Check the allowed_patterns to see what IS approved
2. Try an alternative path that matches allowed patterns, OR
3. Use request_scope_expansion to ask user to add the path to scope"

Edit a file by replacing strings, checking scope before execution.

Returns error if path is not in approved scope patterns.

The file must already exist. Use write_file_in_scope to create new files.

Example usage:
- Replace function implementation
- Update variable values
- Modify configuration settings

Returns scope violation error if path not approved."
