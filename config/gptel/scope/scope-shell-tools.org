#+title: GPTEL Scope Manager - Shell and Meta Tools
#+author: Jeff Farr
#+property: header-args:elisp :tangle scope-shell-tools.el :comments both

* Overview

This module provides scope-aware shell execution tools and meta tools for scope expansion. It includes:

1. *Shell tool*: =run_approved_command= - Execute shell commands with whitelist/blacklist checking
2. *Meta tool*: =request_scope_expansion= - LLM requests user approval to expand scope

** Shell Command Scoping

Scope plans support:
- *allow_commands*: Whitelist of allowed command names (e.g., "ls", "git status")
- *deny_commands*: Blacklist patterns (substring matching, e.g., "rm -rf", "sudo")

Deny patterns override allow patterns for security.

* Dependencies

* Run Approved Command Tool (Scope-Aware)

Execute shell command if allowed by scope plan.

#+begin_src elisp
(gptel-make-tool
 :name "run_approved_command"
 :description "Execute shell command if allowed by scope plan.
Checks command against allow_commands (whitelist) and deny_commands (blacklist).

Allow patterns: Exact command name match (e.g., 'ls' allows 'ls -la')
Deny patterns: Substring match (e.g., 'rm -rf' blocks any command containing 'rm -rf')

Deny patterns override allow patterns for security.

Returns command output on success or scope violation error if not approved.
Use request_scope_expansion to ask user to add command to allowed list."

LLM uses this tool to explicitly request user approval for expanding scope.

 :name "request_scope_expansion"
 :description "Request user approval to expand scope plan with new patterns.

Use this when operations are denied by scope and you need user permission.
Displays approval dialog to user explaining why access is needed.

The user will see:
- Resource type (filesystem, org_roam, shell)
- Patterns you want to add
- Your justification for why access is needed

Returns success with patterns_added if user approves, or user_denied if rejected.

IMPORTANT: Always explain to the user WHY you need the expanded access in the justification.
Be specific about what you're trying to accomplish."
