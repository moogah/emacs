* Introduction
This file configures EasyPG for GPG encryption, which handles encrypted authentication files
and other sensitive data in Emacs.

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/epa.html][EasyPG Assistant (EPA)]] is an Emacs interface to the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) encryption tool,
allowing you to encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify files directly from Emacs.

* Lexical Binding
Enable lexical binding for better closures and variable scoping.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

* Configuration
Set up EasyPG and auth-source to handle encrypted credentials.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; ===============================================================================
;; Configure EasyPG
;; ===============================================================================

;; Set authentication source (use encrypted GPG file)
(setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg"))

;; Don't ask which key to use when encrypting
(setq epa-file-select-keys nil)

;; Encrypt to this key by default
(setq epa-file-encrypt-to '("moogah@gmail.com"))

* Install and configure gpg

** Install Packages

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
  brew install gpg
#+end_src

Install pinentry to allow using keychain to enter the password for gpg
#+begin_src shell :tangle no
  brew install pinentry-mac
#+end_src

Then configure gpg to use pinentry via the config file

~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

with the line: pinentry-program /opt/homebrew/bin/pinentry-mac

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
  cat ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: pinentry-program /opt/homebrew/bin/pinentry-mac

** Create gpg key

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
  gpg --full-generate-key
#+end_src

** Save passphrase in keychain

To avoid having to enter the passphrase (which will sometimes be a problem with some clients trying to decrypt) we can use this command:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
  echo test | gpg -e -r <PUT THE KEY ID HERE> | gpg -d
#+end_src 

This sends 'test' to the encryption command, and pipes that encrypted result to the decrypt command.  When run on the CLI this will pop-up the pinentry window to enter the passphrase, and there will be a checkbox to save to keychain.

After doing this once, we can run the command again and it will read the passphrase from the keychain instead of prompting for user input

* Usage
To use GPG encryption in Emacs:

- Save a file with `.gpg` extension to automatically encrypt it
- Open a `.gpg` file to automatically decrypt it (you may be prompted for your passphrase)
- `auth-source` will automatically use encrypted credentials for packages like SMTP email, mu4e, etc.

The `~/.authinfo.gpg` file format looks like:
#+begin_example
machine smtp.gmail.com login your-email@gmail.com password your-password port 587
machine imap.gmail.com login your-email@gmail.com password your-password port 993
#+end_example

* Troubleshooting
This section contains troubleshooting commands and guidance that won't be tangled into the config.

** GPG Key Management
To check which GPG keys are available on your system:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
# List all GPG keys
gpg --list-keys

# List secret keys (your private keys)
gpg --list-secret-keys

# Check for a specific key
gpg --list-keys your@email.com
#+end_src

** Common GPG Errors
*** "GPG error: no usable configuration"
This typically happens when:
1. The email specified in ~epa-file-encrypt-to~ doesn't match any key in your keyring
2. GPG can't access your keys or the pinentry program isn't working
3. Your file is encrypted with a passphrase but Emacs is configured for public key encryption
4. There's a mismatch between the GPG version Emacs is using and your system GPG

Steps to fix:
1. Confirm your GPG setup works at all:
   #+begin_src shell :tangle no
   echo "test" | gpg --encrypt --recipient your@email.com | gpg --decrypt
   #+end_src
   
2. Check your GPG version and configuration:
   #+begin_src shell :tangle no
   gpg --version
   cat ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
   #+end_src

3. If using a machine-specific key, create a local config file:
   #+begin_src shell :tangle no
   # Get your hostname
   hostname
   
   # Create a machine-specific config
   mkdir -p ~/src/dotfiles/emacs/local
   #+end_src
   
   Then create a file in ~/src/dotfiles/emacs/local/[HOSTNAME].el with:
   
   For public key encryption:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
   ;; Machine-specific configuration for public key encryption
   (setq epa-file-encrypt-to '("your@actual.email"))
   (setq epa-pinentry-mode 'loopback)
   #+end_src
   
   For passphrase encryption:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
   ;; Machine-specific configuration for passphrase encryption
   (setq epa-file-encrypt-to nil)
   (setq epa-file-select-keys nil)
   (setq epa-pinentry-mode 'loopback)
   (setq epg-gpg-program "/path/to/your/gpg") ;; Use `which gpg` to find this
   #+end_src

** Manually Working with Encrypted Files
If you need to manually decrypt or re-encrypt .authinfo.gpg:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
# Make a backup (decrypt)
gpg --decrypt ~/.authinfo.gpg > ~/.authinfo.backup

# Remove encrypted file
rm ~/.authinfo.gpg

# Re-encrypt with correct key
gpg --encrypt --recipient your@actual.email ~/.authinfo.backup
mv ~/.authinfo.backup.gpg ~/.authinfo.gpg
#+end_src

** Testing GPG in Emacs
Run these commands in *scratch* buffer to debug GPG issues:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Check encryption settings
(message "Encrypt to: %s" epa-file-encrypt-to)
(message "Pinentry mode: %s" epa-pinentry-mode)

;; Test auth-source
(require 'auth-source)
(message "Auth sources: %s" auth-sources)

;; Check which executable Emacs is using for GPG
(message "EPG program: %s" epg-gpg-program)
#+end_src

** GPG Agent Issues
Sometimes you may encounter issues with the GPG agent version or configuration.

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
# Check GPG and GPG-agent versions
gpg --version
gpg-agent --version

# If you see warnings about outdated agents, restart them
gpgconf --kill all

# Test GPG passphrase decryption
echo "test" | gpg --symmetric | gpg --decrypt

# Check GPG agent configuration
cat ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

# Check for multiple GPG installations (common on macOS)
which gpg
ls -la /usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/gpg* 2>/dev/null
ls -la /opt/homebrew/bin/gpg* 2>/dev/null
ls -la /usr/local/bin/gpg* 2>/dev/null

# Check GPG-related environment variables
env | grep -i gpg
#+end_src

*** Multiple GPG installations on macOS
A common issue on macOS is having multiple GPG installations:

1. GPG Suite (MacGPG2) typically installed in `/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/`
2. Homebrew-installed GPG typically in `/opt/homebrew/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin/`

If your .authinfo.gpg file was encrypted with one version but Emacs is using another, 
you may encounter compatibility issues. In that case:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Use the specific GPG version that matches the one used to encrypt your files
(setq epg-gpg-program "/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/gpg") ;; or whichever is appropriate

;; Clear the GPG agent info to avoid version mismatches
(setenv "GPG_AGENT_INFO" nil)

;; Enable passphrase caching for symmetric encryption
(setq epa-file-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t)
#+end_src

*** macOS Applications Folder Emacs
When running Emacs from the Applications folder on macOS (Emacs.app), you might need
additional configuration to ensure it can find your GPG installation:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; For macOS Applications folder Emacs, make sure paths are properly set
(when (file-exists-p "/Applications/Emacs.app")
  ;; Ensure the exec path includes the GPG binary locations
  (add-to-list 'exec-path "/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin")
  (add-to-list 'exec-path "/opt/homebrew/bin"))

;; Force GPG to use the loopback pinentry for passphrase input
(setq epg-gpg-args '("--pinentry-mode" "loopback"))

;; Set GPG home directory explicitly
(setq epg-gpg-home-directory "~/.gnupg")
#+end_src

The GUI Emacs.app often has a different environment than terminal-launched Emacs, which can
cause issues with finding the correct GPG binaries. These settings help ensure that
Applications folder Emacs can find and use your GPG installation properly.

For issues with passphrase-encrypted files, ensure:
1. You've set ~epa-file-encrypt-to~ to ~nil~ to use symmetric encryption
2. The ~epa-pinentry-mode~ is set to ~'loopback~ to allow Emacs to prompt for the passphrase
3. You're using the correct GPG program with ~epg-gpg-program~
