# Activities State

This directory contains git-controlled activities data from the `activities.el` package.

## Files

- `activities-activities` - Serialized activities data (window configurations, buffer states, project associations)

## Why Git-Controlled?

Unlike most runtime state (in `runtime/`), activities are valuable configurations that:
- Define task-oriented workspaces with specific window layouts
- Include project associations (git branches, worktrees, org-roam documents)
- Represent intentional, reusable workspace setups

Keeping this under version control allows:
- Backup and restore of workspace configurations
- Sharing workspace setups across machines
- History tracking of workspace evolution

## Configuration

This location is configured in `config/activities/activities.org`:
```elisp
(put 'activities-activities 'persist-location
     (expand-file-name "state/activities/" jf/emacs-dir))
```

## Format

The data is serialized Emacs Lisp generated by `persist.el`. It contains `activities-activity` structs with:
- Window state (from `window-state-get`)
- Buffer bookmarks (for restoration)
- Activity extensions metadata (projects, org-roam links, gptel sessions)
