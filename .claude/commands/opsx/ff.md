description: Create a change and generate all artifacts needed for implementation in one go

---

Fast-forward through artifact creation - generate everything needed to start implementation.

**Input**: The argument after `/opsx:ff` is the change name (kebab-case), OR a description of what the user wants to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   This creates a scaffolded change at `openspec/changes/<name>/`.

3. **Get the artifact build order**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies

4. **Create artifacts in sequence until design is complete**

   Use the **TaskCreate tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        ```bash
        openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        ```
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
        - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - `outputPath`: Where to write the artifact
        - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - **Special handling for artifact types:**
        - **architecture**: Engage user in dialog about testing approach using **AskUserQuestion**:
          - Test framework and version
          - Test file location
          - Naming conventions
          - How to run tests
          - Mock/stub patterns
          - Test helpers approach
          - Document all decisions in architecture.md
        - **tests**: Create actual test files (not documentation):
          - Use test location/framework from architecture.md
          - Create test files mapping spec scenarios to test cases
          - Use naming from architecture.md conventions
          - Include test helpers if specified
          - Tests should be runnable but may fail (TDD red phase)
          - Use skip/expected-fail for tests requiring future work
        - **Other artifacts**: Create using `template` as structure
      - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
      - Show brief progress: "✓ Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until design is complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Stop when design artifact has `status: "done"`
      - Skip tasks artifact (beads replace tasks)

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

5. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing artifacts through design, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All planning artifacts created!"
- Prompt: "Next: Create Beads with `/opsx:create-beads` to generate implementation work items from design and specs."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use the `template` as a starting point, filling in based on context

**Guardrails**
- Create artifacts through design (proposal → specs → design)
- Skip tasks artifact (beads replace tasks)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
